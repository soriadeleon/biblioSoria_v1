This project has been created to practice and learn how to automate with Python and Selenium.
So, if you are reading this and you have advice on how to improve it, don't hesitate to contact me.

Each of the files represents an evolution of the previous file. I know I could do it all on the same file.
#I have chosen to do it this way in order to have the files for later review.

Note: this is practiced with production sites because they represent the most real practical case of testing. That is, locators are missing or they #repeat and force me to think about how I can do the test. I know there are websites to practice automation but they are prepared to make everything #simple.
